# Typescript Numbers

This follows general principles used in the creation of the Natural Number system.

1. There exists a set (in our case a tuple) of size 0, that contains nothing. We call this Zero
2. For every number n, there exists Succ(n) called the successor of n and denoted n + 1.

## Idea

We are mapping between type theoretic numbers and javascript Number type. We denote the former simply Num.
